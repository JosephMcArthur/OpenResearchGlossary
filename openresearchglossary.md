# Open Glossary

This glossary is designed to to be a resource to help inform people about the culture of 'open scholarship'. 

## Core definitions

* **Open Access (OA)** - making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts freely available via the Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. May also refer to theses, books, book chapters, monographs and other content. ([BOAI](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/))

* **Open data** - making data freely available on the public internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, pass them to software or use them for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. ([Panton Principles](http://pantonprinciples.org/))

* **Open Educational Resources (OER)** - high quality, openly licensed, online educational materials for sharing, use, and reuse. They act as a mechanism for instructional innovation as networks of teachers and learners share best practices. ([Source](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources))

* **Open Source Software (OSS)** - availability of source code for a piece of software, along with an [open source license](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fopensource.org%2Flicenses%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGksJTh8s2XUea423wxkKdmzx59pw) permitting reuse, adaptation, and further distribution. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software))

* **Article Processing Charge (APC)** - a fee charged to the author, creator, or institution to cover the cost of an article, rather than charging the potential reader of the article. APCs may apply to both commercial and Open Access publications. APCs are sometimes charged to authors in order to cover the cost of publishing and disseminating an article in an Open Access scholarly journal. ([Source](http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/glossary/))

* **Repository (article)** - an archive to deposit manuscripts. These can be personal, institutional, on websites such as [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/) or [Academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/), or subject-based such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/).

* **Repository (software)** - a collection of files managed with version control software (e.g., bzr, hg, git, csv, svn, etc.). Can be hosted by third-party (e.g., github, bitbucket, sourceforge), by an institution, or self-hosted locally.

* **Institutional Repository** - An online database designed to collect the intellectual output of a particular institution or university, including digital collections such as electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), pre-prints, or faculty scholarship, and presents associated metadata regarding the these items. ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary#oscp_glossary-page-44))

* **Embargo period** - a length of time imposed on a research output for users who have not paid for access, or do not have institutional access, before it is made freely available. 

* **Reproducibility** - the similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods but under different conditions (i.e., pertains to results).

* **Repeatability** - the similarity between results of a study or experiment and independent results obtained with the same methods and under identical conditions (i.e., pertains to methods and analysis).

* **Publishing** - to make a research output available to the public. Commonly refers to the release of works by publishers, irrespective of whether public access is granted or not.

* **Sharing** - the joint use of a resource or space. A fundamental aspect of collaborative research. As most research is digitally-authored & digitally-published, the resulting digital content is non-rivalrous and can be shared without any loss to the original creator.

* **Paywall** - restriction via a financial barrier to research, often implemented by legacy publishers. Can be removed by personal or institutional subscription. See Loginwall for a barrier that prevents access, without asking for money to unlock access.

* **Funder** - an institute, corporation or government body that provides financial assistance for research.

* **Publisher** - a company whose purpose is to make the outputs of research publicly available.

* **Creative work** - An original, identifiable piece of content, such as an academic paper, a diagram, a photograph, or a video clip. Owners of creative works have rights, such as copyright, that they might reserve to keep control of the content, or relinquish to allow others to share and reuse that content.

* **Intellectual property (IP)** - a legal term that refers to creations of the mind. Examples of intellectual property include music, literature, and other artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and phrases, symbols, and designs.

* **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** - the rights given to the owners of intellectual property. IPR is protected either automatically (eg copyright, design rights) or by registering or applying for it (eg trademarks, patents). Protecting your intellectual property makes it easier to take legal action against anyone who steals or copies it. IPR can be legally sold, assigned or licenced by the creator to other parties, or joint-owned.

* **Copyright** - The aspect of Intellectual property that gives creators the right to permit (or not permit) what happens to their creations, as opposed to trademark rights or moral rights.

* **Copyleft** - a form of licensing that makes a creative work freely available to be modified, and requiring all modified and extended versions of the creative work to be free as well. Open Access does not require works to be copyleft, nor does it necessarily exclude copyleft works from being open access. The recommended licence (CC-BY) for academic publishing is not copyleft.

* **Subscription** - a form of business model whereby a fee is paid in order to gain access to a product or service - in this case, the outputs of scholarly research.

* **Toll access** - whereby a fee is required to pass a paywall to access research. 

* **Legacy publisher** - a publisher that historically has operated on a paywall-based business model. 

* **Open access publisher** - a publisher that publishes all research articles as open access articles. Most legacy publishers have options to make journals at least partially open access.

* **Open access journal** - a journal that exclusively comprises open access articles. 

* **Impact** - the scale of use of research outputs both inside and outside of academia.

* **Self-archiving** - making a copy of a manuscript available through a personal website, institutional repository, or other repository. 

* **Scholarly Communication** - The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community. The creation, transformation, dissemination, and preservation of knowledge related to teaching, research, and scholarly endeavors; the process of academics, scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their research findings so that they are available to the wider academic community. (Sources: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarly_communication), [University of Pittsburgh](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary#oscp_glossary-page-77))

* **Preprint** - a manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.

* **Post-print** - a manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed (rarely used).

* **Version of Record (VOR)** - the final version of a manuscript, after peer review and processing by a publishers.

* **Hybrid** - a type of journal in which certain articles are made open access for typically a significantly higher price (relative to full OA journals), while others remain toll access. 

* **Accepted author manuscript** - the version of a manuscript that has been accepted by a publisher for publication. 

* **Eprint** - a digital version of a research document available online for a repository.

* **Green OA** - making a version of the manuscript freely available in a repository. 

* **Gold OA** - making the final version of manuscript freely available immediately upon publication by the publisher. 

* **Gratis OA** - the paper is available to read free-of-charge, though its reuse is still restricted, for example by 'All Rights Reserved' copyright. ([source](http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/))

* **Libre OA** - the paper is made available under an open licence, allowing it to be shared and reused, depending on which licence is used. ([source](http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/)) (Libre and Gratis refer to copyright and licensing restrictions)

## Licensing

* **Creative Commons** - A suite of licences that set out the rights of authors and users, providing alternatives to the standard copyright. CC licences are widely used, simple to state, machine readable and have been created by legal experts. There are a variety of CC licences, each of which use one or more clauses, examples of which are given below. ([Source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)) Some licences are compatible with Open Access in the Budapest sense, and some are not. ([Choosing a license](http://creativecommons.org/choose/))

* **CC Attribution (BY)** - a licence clause that allows the reuse, sharing, and remixing of materials providing the original author is appropriately attributed. Aside from attribution the CC-BY licence has no other restrictions on copying. Compatible with free cultural works.

* **CC NonCommercial (NC)** - a licence clause allowing the reuse, sharing, and remixing of materials providing that it is for non-commercial purposes. Not compatible with free cultural works. 

* **CC NoDerivatives (ND)** - a licence clause requiring that derivatives are not made of the original works. Not compatible with free cultural works.

* **CC ShareAlike (SA)** - a licence clause requiring that derivative works have the same licence as the original. Compatible with free cultural works.

* **MIT License** - An open and permissive software license. ([Source](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) 

* **Author Addendum** - An author addendum is a supplemental or added agreement to a publishing contract that defines or changes the terms of the contract, often focusing on the transfer of copyright ownership. For authors of scholarly works, an author addendum to a publisher's standard publication contract may be necessary to help ensure that authors protect important rights, such as the right to post their articles online to a personal website or in a digital repository; the right to use their works within a classroom setting; or the right to use their works as the foundation for future research. ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary))

## Journal types

* **Megajournal** - a journal with editorial criteria based on scientific soundness instead of a priori estimated newsworthiness or 'impact'.

* **Journal** - an aggregation of published research articles. Historically divided into volumes and issues. 

* **Overlay journals** - An open access, electronic journal that does not produce its own content, but selects and curates groups of articles that are already freely available online. An example of this is an 'Epijournal'. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal))

* **Epub** - A free and open [e-book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-book) standard by the [International Digital publishing Forum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Digital_Publishing_Forum).

Other articles in the journal remain accessible only through subscription. Such journals are known as "hybrid journals." ([Source: MIT](http://libraries.mit.edu/scholarly/hybrid-journals/))

* **Library-based publishing** - Many academic libraries are now beginning to act as publishers for scholarly works produced in their institutions and elsewhere.  In some cases, the library works with the university scholarly press to publish works. In other cases, the library publishes works independently or separately from the academic press. Library-based publishers are often strongly in favor of Open Access. ([Library Publishing Coalition](http://www.librarypublishing.org))

## Peer review

* **Peer review** - a process by which a research article is vetted by experts in community before publication. ([Sense About Science](http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/peer-review.html))

* **Open review** - when reviews are made openly available, typically alongside the article. 

* **Signed peer review** - when the individual reviews are publicly signed by those who conducted them. 

* **Portable peer review** - independent peer review that travels with a manuscript that is submitted to subsequent different journals, designed to combat redundancy in the peer review process. ([Rubriq](http://www.rubriq.com/))

* **Double blind peer review** - when the reviewers don't know who the authors are, and vice versa. 

* **Registered Reports** - A type of publication in which peer review of the suggested method is completed prior to data collection and analysis. Accepted papers then are guaranteed publication in the journal if the authors follow through with the registered methodology ([Source](https://osf.io/8mpji/wiki/home/))

## Assessment and metrics

* **Altmetrics** - Altmetrics are alternative ways of recording and measuring the use and impact of scholarship. Rather than solely counting the number of times a work is cited in scholarly literature, alternative metrics also measure and analyze social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, blogs, wikis, etc.), document downloads, links to publishing and unpublished research, and other uses of research literature, in order to provide a more comprehensive measurement of scholarships reach and impact. ([Source)](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary)

* **Article-level metrics** - all types of article-level metrics including download and usage statistics, citations, and article-level altmetrics ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary)).

* **Bibliometrics** - Bibliometrics is the branch of library and information science concerned with the application of mathematical and statistical analysis to bibliography. Bibliometrics involves the statistical analysis of books, articles, or other publications. 

* **Impact factor** - a numerical measure that indicates the average number of citations to articles published over the previous two years in a journal, and frequently used as a proxy for a journal's relative importance.

* **H-index** - a personal metric that relates the number of citations to the number of published papers for an academic. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index))

* **Journal level metrics** - metrics that apply to all papers published within a journal. A common example is Thomson Reuters' journal impact factor.

* **Copy editing** - a type of editing designed to improve the formatting, style, and accuracy of text. It usually does not involve changing the content of the original text.

* **Annotation** - a comment with specific location and context, either inline or in the margin of a text document, or within a region of an image or video, or located within a specific row or cell of data in a data set.  

* **Citation** - a reference to a published or unpublished source embedded in content, for the purposes of acknowledging the work and relevance of others to the topic of discussion where the citation appears.

* **References** - defines a relationship between one object, a designator, and a second object, a source. Usually takes the form of a bibliography of academic papers at the end of a research manuscript.

* **Submission fee** - a fee levied by some publishers for submitting a manuscript to their journals.

* **Accessibility** - refers to the degree of access. Defined by an end-user basis, depending on their ability to understand or reuse content.

* **Mixed citation** - a textual, bibliographic description of a work that is cited within text.

* **Data archiving** - the process of moving data to a storage device for long-term preservation. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_data_archiving))

* **Computational reproducibility** - when publishing computational findings, include details and access to the underlying code, data, and implementation.

* **Empirical reproducibility** - the reproduction of results to obtain 'verifiable facts', through improving existing communication standards and reporting.

* **Statistical reproducibility** - validating the statistical results, errors, and confidence measures in research. Also the statistical assessment of repeated results for validation purposes. ([Post from Victoria Stodden](http://edge.org/annual-question/2014/response/25340))

* **Loginwall** - the requirement to log in to a system in order to access content.

* **Shibboleth** - a single sign-in system for computer networks and services on the open Internet. ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(Internet2)))

* **Journal to Wiki publication (J2W)** - Copying text from a published paper to a wiki (such as Wikipedia or Wikibooks), with attribution: legally possible if the licence of the paper is less restrictive than the licence of the wiki.

* **Wiki to Journal publication (W2J)** - Creating a paper on a wiki, using its features for collaboration and informal review, for submission to a journal for formal peer review. Might involve a public wiki such as Wikipedia or Wikiversity, or a specially-created wiki.

* **Fee waiver** - If an institution, research funder or author cannot pay for an Article Processing Charge, many publishers or journals will offer partial or total waiving for fees.

* **Derivative work** - A work based upon one or more pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. ([Source](http://library.pitt.edu/oscp/glossary))

* **Double-dipping** - In the context of Open Access, double-dipping occurs when a journal has an article processing charge (APC) for publishing an author's work, as well as requiring payment (usually through a subscription fee) by the potential user of the work. This model makes the institution or author pay twice to access the work. ([Source](http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/glossary/))
